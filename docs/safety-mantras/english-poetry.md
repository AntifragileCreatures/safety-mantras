## Allen Ginsberg

### Howl (Abridged)
Allen Ginsberg

I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn 
looking for an angry fix 
**angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of the night**. 


### Howl
**Allen Ginsberg**

I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,

dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,

angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,

who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,

who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,

who passed through universities with radiant eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of money and war,

who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,

who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall,

who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York,

who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night

with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and endless balls,

incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping towards poles of Canada & Paterson, illuminating all the motionless world of Time between,

Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brooklyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind,

who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo,

who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford's floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate Fugazzi's, listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox,

who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge,

a lost batallion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills off Empire State out of the moon

yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars,

whose intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement,

who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous picture postcards of Atlantic City Hall,

suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grindings and migraines of China under junk-withdrawal in Newark's bleak furnished room,

who wandered around and around at midnight in the railway yard wondering where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts,

who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow toward lonesome farms in grandfather night,

who studied Plotinus Poe St John of the Cross telepathy and bop kabbalah because the cosmos instinctively vibrated at their feet in Kansas,

who loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary indian angels who were visionary indian angels,

who thought they were only mad when Baltimore gleamed in supernatural ecstasy,

who jumped in limousines with the Chinaman of Oklahoma on the impulse of winter midnight streetlight smalltown rain,

who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, and followed the brilliant Spaniard to converse about America and Eternity, a hopeless task, and so took ship to Africa,

who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving nothing behind but the shadow of dungarees and the larva and ash of poetry scattered in fireplace Chicago,

who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the FBI in beards and shorts with big pacifist eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incomprehensible leaflets,

who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism, who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square weeping and undressing while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also wailed,

who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons,

who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication,

who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts,

who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists, and screamed with joy,

who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, the sailors, caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love,

who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may, 

who hiccuped endlessly trying to giggle but wound up with a sob behind a partition in a Turkish Bath when the blond & naked angel came to pierce them with a sword,

who lost their loveboys to the three old shrews of fate the one eyed shrew of the heterosexual dollar the one eyed shrew that winks out of the womb and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but sit on her ass and snip the intellectual golden threads of the craftsman's loom,

who copulated ecstatic and insatiate and fell off the bed, and continued along the floor and down the hall and ended fainting on the wall with a vision of ultimate cunt and come eluding the last gyzym of consciousness,

who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling in the sunset, and were red eyed in the morning but were prepared to sweeten the snatch of the sunrise, flashing buttocks under barns and naked in the lake,

who went out whoring through Colorado in myriad stolen night-cars, N.C., secret hero of these poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver—joy to the memory of his innumerable lays of girls in empty lots & diner backyards, moviehouses' rickety rows, on mountaintops in caves or with gaunt waitresses in familiar roadside lonely petticoat upliftings & especially secret gas-station solipsisms of johns, & hometown alleys too,

who faded out in vast sordid movies, were shifted in dreams, woke on a sudden Manhattan, and picked themselves up out of basements hungover with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third Avenue iron dreams & stumbled to unemployment offices,

who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on the snowbank docks waiting for a door in the East River to open to a room full of steamheat and opium,

who created great suicidal dramas on the appartment cliff-banks of the Hudson under the wartime blue floodlight of the moon & their heads shall be crowned with laurel in oblivion,

who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested the crab at the muddy bottom of the rivers of the Bowery,

who wept at the romance of the streets with their pushcarts full of onions and bad music,

who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the bridge, and rose up to build harpsichords in their lofts, who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem crowned with flame under the tubercular sky surrounded by orange crates of theology,

who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty incantations which in the yellow morning were stanzas of gibberish,

who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht & tortillas dreaming of the pure vegetable kingdom,

who plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for an egg,

who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot for an Eternity outside of Time, & alarm clocks fell on their heads every day for the next decade,

who cut their wrists three times unsuccessfully, gave up and were forced to open antique stores where they thought they were growing old and cried,

who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on Madison Avenue amid blasts of leaden verse & the tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments of fashion &amp; the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies of advertising & the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, or were run down by the drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality,

who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup alleyways &amp; firetrucks, not even one free beer,

who sang out of their windows in despair, fell out of the subway, jumped in the filthy Passaic, leaped on negroes, cried all over the street, danced on broken wineglasses barefoot smashed phonograph records of nostalgic 1930s European German jazz finished the whiskey and threw up groaning into the bloody toilet, moans in their ears and the blast of colossal steamwhistles,

who barreled down the highways of the past journeying to each other's hotrod-Golgotha jail-solitude watch Birmingham blues incarnation,

who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out if I had a vision or you had a vision or he had a vision to find out Eternity,

who journeyed to Denver, who died in Denver, who came back to Denver & waited in vain, who watched over Denver &amp; brooded & loned in Denver and finally went away to find out the Time, & now Denver is lonesome for her heroes,

who fell on their knees in hopeless cathedrals praying for each other's salvation and light and breasts, until the soul illuminated its hair for a second,

who crashed through their minds in jail waiting for impossible criminals with golden heads and the charm of reality in their hearts who sang sweet blues to Alcatraz,

who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit, or Rocky Mount to tender Buddha or Tangiers to boys or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive or Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn to the daisychain or grave,

who demanded sanity trials accusing the radio of hypnotism & were left with their insanity &; their hands & a hung jury,

who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturerson Dadaism and subsequently presented themselves on the granite steps of the madhouse with the shaven heads and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding instantaneous lobotomy,

and who were given instead the concrete void of insulin Metrazol electricity hydrotherapy psychotherapy occupational therapy pingpong &; amnesia,

who in humorless protest overturned only one symbolic pingpong table, resting briefly in catatonia,

returning years later truly bald except for a wig of blood, and tears and fingers, to the visible madman doom of the wards of the madtowns of the East,

Pilgrim State's Rockland's and Greystone's foetid halls, bickering with the echoes of the soul, rocking and rolling in the midnight solitude-bench dolmen-realms of love, dream of life a nightmare, bodies turned to stone as heavy as the moon,

with mother finally *****, and the last fantastic book flung out of the tenement window, and the last door closed at 4 A.M. and the last telephone slammed at the wall in reply and the last furnished room emptied down to the last piece of mental furniture, a yellow paper rose twisted on a wire hanger on the closet, and even that imaginary, nothing but a hopeful little bit of hallucination—

ah, Carl, while you are not safe I am not safe, and now you're really in the total animal soup of time—

and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed with a sudden flash of the alchemy of the use of the ellipse the catalog the meter &amp; the vibrating plane,

who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in Time &amp; Space through images juxtaposed, and trapped the archangel of the soulbetween 2 visual images and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun and dash of consciousness together jumping with sensation of Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus

to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human prose and stand before you speechless and intelligent and shaking with shame, rejected yet confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm of thought in his naked and endless head,

the madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown, yet putting down here what might be left to say in time come after death,

and rose incarnate in the ghostly clothes of jazz in the goldhorn shadow of the band and blew the suffering of America's naked mind for love into an eli eli lamma lamma sabacthani saxophone cry that shivered the cities down to the last radio

with the absolute heart of the poem butchered out of their own bodies good to eat a thousand years.

II

What sphinx of cement and aluminium bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?

Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men weeping in the parks!

Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!

Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgement! Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!

Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!

Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose skyscrapers stand in the long streets like endless Jehovas! Moloch whose factories dream and choke in the fog! Moloch whose smokestacks and antennae crown the cities!

Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream angels! Crazy in Moloch! Cocksucker in Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!

Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body! Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy! Moloch whom I abandon! Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the sky!

Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisable suburbs! skeleton treasuries! blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!

They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees, radios, tons! lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!

Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstacies! gone down the American river!

Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit!

Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the flood! Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten years' animal screams and suicides! Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of Time!

Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! the holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! to solitude! waving! carrying flowers! Down to the river! into the street!

Carl Solomon! I'm with you in Rockland

where you're madder than I am

I'm with you in Rockland

where you must feel strange

I'm with you in Rockland

where you imitate the shade of my mother

I'm with you in Rockland

where you've murdered your twelve secretaries

I'm with you in Rockland

where you laugh at this invisible humour

I'm with you in Rockland

where we are great writers on the same dreadful typewriter

I'm with you in Rockland 

where your condition has become serious and is reported on the radio

I'm with you in Rockland 

where the faculties of the skull no longer admit the worms of the senses

I'm with you in Rockland 

where you drink the tea of the breasts of the spinsters of Utica

I'm with you in Rockland 

where you pun on the bodies of your nurses the harpies of the Bronx

I'm with you in Rockland 

where you scream in a straightjacket that you're losing the game of actual pingpong of the abyss

I'm with you in Rockland 

where you bang on the catatonic piano the soul is innocent and immortal it should never die ungodly in an armed madhouse

I'm with you in Rockland 

where fifty more shocks will never return your soul to its body again from its pilgrimage to a cross in the void

I'm with you in Rockland 

where you accuse your doctors of insanity and plot the Hebrew socialist revolution against the fascist national Golgotha

I'm with you in Rockland 

where you will split the heavens of Long Island and resurrect your living human Jesus from the superhuman tomb

I'm with you in Rockland 

where there are twentyfive thousand mad comrades all together singing the final stanzas of the Internationale

I'm with you in Rockland 

where we hug and kiss the United States under our bedsheets the United States that coughs all night and won't let us sleep

I'm with you in Rockland 

where we wake up electrified out of the coma by our own souls' airplanes roaring over the roof they've come to drop angelic bombs the hospital illuminates itself imaginary walls collapse O skinny legions run outside O starry-spangled shock of mercy the eternal war is here O victory forget your underwear we're free

I'm with you in Rockland 

in my dreams you walk dripping from a sea-journey on the highway across America in tears to the door of my cottage in the Western night

## Philip Larkin

### Aubade
**Philip Larkin**

I work all day, and get half-drunk at night.   
Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare.   
In time the **curtain-edges will grow light**.   
Till then I see what's really always there:   
Unresting death, a whole day nearer now,   
Making all thought impossible but how   
And where and when I shall myself die.   
Arid interrogation: yet the dread   
Of dying, and being dead,   
Flashes afresh to hold and horrify.   
The mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse   
The good not done, the love not given, time   
Torn off unused - nor wretchedly because   
An only life can take so long to climb   
Clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never;   
But at the total emptiness for ever,   
The sure extinction that we travel to   
And shall be lost in always. Not to be here,   
Not to be anywhere,   
And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.

This is a special way of being afraid   
No trick dispels. Religion used to try,   
That vast, moth-eaten musical brocade   
Created to pretend we never die,   
And specious stuff that says No rational being   
Can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing   
That this is what we fear - no sight, no sound,   
No touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with,   
Nothing to love or link with,   
The anasthetic from which none come round.    

And so it stays just on the **edge of vision**,   
A small, unfocused blur, a standing chill   
That slows each impulse down to indecision.   
Most things may never happen: this one will,   
And realisation of it rages out   
In furnace-fear when we are caught without   
People or drink. Courage is no good:   
It means not scaring others. Being brave   
Lets no one off the grave.   
Death is no different whined at than withstood. 

Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.   
It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,   
Have always known, know that we can't escape,   
Yet can't accept. One side will have to go.   
Meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring   
In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring   
Intricate rented world begins to rouse.   
The sky is white as clay, with no sun.   
Work has to be done.   
Postmen like doctors go from house to house.

### Myxomatosis
**Philip Larkin**

Caught in the center of a soundless field   
While hot inexplicable hours go by 

What trap is this? Where were its teeth concealed?   
You seem to ask.   
I make a sharp reply,   
Then clean my stick. I'm glad I can't explain   
Just in what jaws you were to suppurate: 

You may have thought things would come right again   
If you could only keep quite still and wait.

### The Mower 

The mower stalled, twice; kneeling, I found   
A hedgehog jammed up against the blades,  
Killed. It had been in the long grass.

I had seen it before, and even fed it, once.  
Now I had mauled its unobtrusive world  
Unmendably. Burial was no help:

Next morning I got up and it did not.  
The first day after a death, the new absence  
Is always the same; **we should be careful  
Of each other, we should be kind  
While there is still time.**

### This Be the Verse
Philip Larkin

They fuck you up, your mum and dad.   
They may not mean to, but they do.   
They fill you with the faults they had
And add some extra, just for you.

But they were fucked up in their turn  
By fools in old-style hats and coats,   
Who half the time were soppy-stern  
And half at one another’s throats.

Man hands on misery to man.  
It deepens like a coastal shelf.  
Get out as early as you can,  
And don’t have any kids yourself.


### A Study of Reading Habits
**Philip Larkin**

When getting my nose in a book  
Cured most things short of school,  
It was worth ruining my eyes  
To know I could still keep cool,  
And deal out the old right hook  
To dirty dogs twice my size.

Later, with inch-thick specs,  
Evil was just my lark:  
Me and my coat and fangs  
Had ripping times in the dark.  
The women I clubbed with sex!  
I broke them up like meringues.

Don't read much now: the dude  
Who lets the girl down before  
The hero arrives, the chap  
Who's yellow and keeps the store  
Seem far too familiar. Get stewed:  
Books are a load of crap.

### Home is so Sad
Philip Larkin

Home is so sad. It stays as it was left,  
Shaped to the comfort of the last to go  
As if to win them back. Instead, bereft  
Of anyone to please, it withers so,  
Having no heart to put aside the theft

And turn again to what it started as,  
A joyous shot at how things ought to be,  
Long fallen wide. You can see how it was:   
Look at the pictures and the cutlery.  
The music in the piano stool. That vase.

## O Captain! My Captain!
**Walt Whitman**

**O Captain! My Captain!  
O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done**;  
The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;  
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,  
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:  
But O heart! heart! heart!  
O the bleeding drops of red,  
Where on the deck my Captain lies,  
Fallen cold and dead.  

O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;  
Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills;  
For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding;  
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;  
Here Captain! dear father!  
This arm beneath your head;  
It is some dream that on the deck,  
You've fallen cold and dead.

My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;  
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;  
The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;  
From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;   
Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!  
But I, with mournful tread,  
Walk the deck my Captain lies,  
Fallen cold and dead. 

## He Who Would Valiant Be
John Bunyan

He who would valiant be ’gainst all disaster,  
Let him in constancy follow the Master.  
There’s no discouragement shall make him once relent  
His first avowed intent to be a pilgrim.

Who so beset him round with dismal stories  
Do but themselves confound—his strength the more is.  
No foes shall stay his might; though he with giants fight,  
He will make good his right to be a pilgrim.

Since, Lord, Thou dost defend us with Thy Spirit  
We know we at the end, shall life inherit.  
Then fancies flee away! **I’ll fear not what men say,  
I’ll labor night and day to be a pilgrim**.

## Kissass
**Allen Ginsberg**

Kissass is the Part of Peace  
America will have to Kissass Mother Earth  
Whites have to Kissass blacks, for Peace & Pleasure,   
Only Pathway to Peace, Kissass. 

## George Gray
**Edgar Lee Masters**

I have studied many times  
The marble which was chiseled for me --  
A boat with a **furled sail** at rest in a harbor.  
In truth it pictures not my destination
But my life.

For **love** was offered me and I shrank from its disillusionment;  
**Sorrow** knocked at my door, but I was afraid;  
**Ambition** called to me, but I dreaded the chances.  
Yet all the while I hungered for meaning in my life.

And now I know that we must **lift the sail**  
And **catch the winds of destiny**  
Wherever they drive the boat.  
To put meaning in one's life may end in madness,  
But life without meaning is the torture  
Of restlessness and vague desire --  
It is a boat longing for the sea and yet afraid. 

## Ozymandias
Percy Bysshe Shelley

I met a traveler from an antique land  
Who said: `Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,  
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,  
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.  

And on the pedestal these words appear --  
"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:  
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"  
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare  
The lone and level sands stretch far away.' 

## The Eagle
BY ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON

He clasps the crag with crooked hands;  
Close to the sun in lonely lands,  
Ring'd with the azure world, he stands.

The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;  
He watches from his mountain walls,  
And like a thunderbolt he falls.

## No Man Is An Island
John Donne

No man is an island,  
Entire of itself.  
Each is a piece of the continent,  
A part of the main.  
If a clod be washed away by the sea,  
Europe is the less.  
As well as if a promontory were.  
As well as if a manor of thine own  
Or of thine friend's were.

**Each man's death diminishes me,  
For I am involved in mankind.  
Therefore, send not to know  
For whom the bell tolls,  
It tolls for thee. **

## The Philosopher’s Drinking Song

Oh **Immanuel Kant** was a real piss-ant; he was very seldom stable.  
**Martin Heidegger** was a boozy beggar; he could think you under the table  

**David Hume** could out-consume Schopenhauer and Hegel.  
And **Wittgenstein** was a beery swine who was just as sloshed as Schlegel.  
There's nothing **Nietzsche** couldn't teach 'ya 'bout the raising of the wrist.  
**Socrates**, himself, was permanently pissed.

**John Stuart Mill**, of his own free will, on half a pint of shandy got spectacularly ill.  
**Plato**, they say, could stick it away, half a crate of whiskey every day!  
**Aristotle**, Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle,

And **Thomas Hobbes** was fond of his Dram.  
And **René Descartes** was a drunken fart:  
"I drink, therefore I am."

Yes, **Socrates** himself is particularly missed;  
A lovely little thinker, a lovely little thinker, a lovely little thinker but a bugger when he's pissed

## Sacrifice
Tagore

The **division of days and nights** is not for me, not that of months and years. For me the stream of time has stopped on whose waves dances the world like straws and twigs. In this dark cave I am alone, merged in myself and the eternal night is still like a mountain lake afraid of its own depth. Water oozed and drips from the cracks and in the pools float the ancient frogs. I sit chanting the incantation of nothingness. The worlds limits recede, line after line.

Now, when I am free of fears and desires, when the mist has vanished, and my reason shines pure and bright, let me go out in the kingdom of light, and sit upon its heart, untouched and unmoved.

## Gitanjali – verse 37
Tagore

I thought that my **voyage** had come to its end at the last limit of my power,—that the path before me was closed, that provisions were exhausted and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity.

But I find that thy will knows no end in me. **And when old words die out on the tongue, new melodies break forth from the heart**; and where the old tracks are lost, new country is revealed with its wonders.

## In Search of Lost Time

Dear, dear, it’s just as they used to say in my poor mother’s day:  
Frogs and snails and puppy-dogs’ tails,  
And dirty sluts in plenty,  
Smell sweeter than roses in young men’s noses  
When the heart is one-and-twenty.

## On the Road
Jack Kerouac (On the Road)

The only people who interest me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like **fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars** and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes “Awww!” 

## The Ogre
W. H. Auden, British poet and essayist, August 1968

The Ogre does what ogres can,  
Deeds quite impossible for Man,  
But one prize is beyond his reach:  
The Ogre cannot master speech.

About a subjugated plain,  
Among it's desperate and slain,  
The Ogre stalks with hands on hips,  
While drivel gushes from his lips. 

## If
Rudyard Kipling

**If you can keep your head** when all about you   
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
**If you can trust yourself** when all men doubt you, 
But make allowance for their doubting too;   
**If you can wait** and not be tired by waiting, 
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,  
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,  
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

**If you can dream**—and not make dreams your master;   
**If you can think**—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster 
And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken  
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,  
**Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools**.

**If you can make one heap** of all your winnings   
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,  
And lose, and start again at your beginnings   
**And never breathe a word about your loss**;   
**If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew**   
To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you   
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ 

**If you can talk with crowds** and keep your virtue,   
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,   
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,   
If all men count with you, but none too much;   
**If you can fill the unforgiving minute**   
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

## Invictus
https://invictusexplained.wordpress.com/

Out of the night that covers me,   
Black as the pit from pole to pole,   
I thank whatever gods may be   
For my unconquerable soul. 

In the fell clutch of circumstance   
I have not winced nor cried aloud.   
Under the bludgeonings of chance   
My head is bloody, but unbowed. 

Beyond this place of wrath and tears   
Looms but the Horror of the shade,   
And yet the menace of the years   
Finds and shall find me unafraid. 

It matters not how strait the gate,   
How charged with punishments the scroll,   
I am the master of my fate,   
I am the captain of my soul. 

## Alone with Everybody
Charles Bukowski

the flesh covers the bone   
and they put a mind   
in there and   
sometimes a soul,   
and the women break   
vases against the walls   
and the men drink too   
much   
and nobody finds the   
one   
but keep   
looking   
crawling in and out   
of beds.   
flesh covers   
the bone and the   
flesh searches   
for more than   
flesh. 

there's no chance   
at all:   
we are all trapped   
by a singular fate. 

nobody ever finds the one. 

the city dumps fill   
the junkyards fill   
the madhouses fill   
the hospitals fill   
the graveyards fill 

nothing else fills. 

## Krishna

I love the man:  
Who hates not nor exults  
Who mourns not nor desires  
Who is the same to friend and foe  
Is the same whether he is respected or despised…  
Is the same in heat and in cold….  
Is the same in pleasure and in pain…  
Who puts away attachment and is unmoved by praise or blame…  
Who is contented by whatever comes his way…

## When Breath Becomes Air

You that seek what life is in air  
Now find it air that once was breath  
New names unknown, old names gone  
Till time ends bodies but souls none  
**Reader, then make time while you be   
But steps to your eternity**

## Fear - Dune

I must not fear  
Fear is the mind killer that brings total obliteration  
I will face my fear  
I will let it pass over me and through me  
And when it has gone past, I will turn my inner eye to see its path  
Where fear has gone, nothing will remain.  
Only I will remain

## Heijoshin - calm
Santoso Hanitijo Montreal, 2013

What is Heijoshin (平常心) ? Heijoshin literally means ordinary mind/heart. **It is a state of mind when you look at thing as what it is and nothing more**. There is no fear, no doubt, no surprise and no confusion. In Kendo, we must cultivate this mindset that will enable us to confront any situation with an ordinary mind, that is to deal with it **as if nothing special or out of ordinary**. If we look at the first two letters of Heijoshin in Kanji, 平常 **(Heijo) means flat or calm as usual**.

Therefore, Heijoshin simply implies having a calm mind as usual when facing any situation. There is a known saying applicable to this state of mind in Kendo: “**walk down the road of fear, through the valley and the shadow of doubt, cross over the mountain of surprise, and bravely sail beyond the ocean of confusion (clamor and confusion)**.” 

Fear, doubt, surprise and confusion are all the creations of our own thought or imagination. It is our human nature to fear when facing a situation, and out of fear appear the doubt; doubt will question our ability to handle the situation; we will then be caught by surprise the situation is not as what we think; and finally it will lead us to confusion. Therefore, if we could face the situation with Heijoshin, we will be able to look at thing or situation as what it is. **With a calm mind as usual, we will be able to notice the snake coiling under the window in the shadow of fear is in fact only a coil of rope**. 

## Desiderata
**Max Ehrmann**

Desideratum - something that is needed or wanted.

Desiderata (plural)

**Go placidly amid the noise and haste**,  
and remember what peace there may be in silence.  
As far as possible without surrender  
be on good terms with all persons.  
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;  
and listen to others,  
even the dull and the ignorant;  
they too have their story.

**Avoid loud and aggressive persons**,  
they are vexations to the spirit.  
If you compare yourself with others,  
you may become vain and bitter;  
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.

**Keep interested in your own career, however humble**;  
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.  
Exercise caution in your business affairs;  
for the world is full of trickery.  
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;  
many persons strive for high ideals;  
and everywhere life is full of heroism. 

**Be yourself**.  
Especially, do not feign affection.  
Neither be cynical about love;  
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment  
it is as perennial as the grass.

**Take kindly the counsel of the years**,  
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.  
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.  
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.  
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.  
Beyond a wholesome discipline,  
be gentle with yourself. 

**You are a child of the universe**,  
no less than the trees and the stars;  
you have a right to be here.  
**And whether or not it is clear to you,  
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should**. 

Therefore be at peace with God,  
whatever you conceive Him to be,  
and whatever your labors and aspirations,  
in the noisy confusion of life **keep peace with your soul**. 

With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,  
it is still a beautiful world.  
Be cheerful.  
Strive to be happy. 


## Tonight I Can Write The Saddest Lines
Pablo Neruda

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.

Write, for example,'The night is shattered
and the **blue stars shiver in the distance**.'

The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.

Through nights like this one I held her in my arms
I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.

She loved me sometimes, and I loved her too.
How could one not have loved her great still eyes.

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.

To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.
And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.

What does it matter that my love could not keep her.
The night is shattered and she is not with me.

This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.
My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.

My sight searches for her as though to go to her.
My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.

The same night whitening the same trees.
We, of that time, are no longer the same.

I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.
My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.

Another's. She will be another's. Like my kisses before.
Her voide. Her bright body. Her inifinite eyes.

I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her. 
Love is so short, forgetting is so long.

Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms
my sould is not satisfied that it has lost her.

Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer
and these the last verses that I write for her. 

## Forget your perfect offering
Leonard Cohen

Song: Anthem

Ring the bells that still can ring   
Forget your perfect offering  
There is a crack, a crack in everything  
That’s how the light gets in.

## Middlemarch – Closing Lines
The growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been is half owing to the number who **lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs**.

## To be of use
Marge Piercy

The people I love the best  
jump into work head first  
without dallying in the shallows  
and swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.  
They seem to become natives of that element,  
the black sleek heads of seals  
bouncing like half-submerged balls.

I love people who **harness themselves**, an **ox to a heavy cart**,  
who **pull like water buffalo**, with **massive patience**,  
who **strain in the mud and the muck** to move things forward,  
who **do what has to be done**, again and again.

I want to be with people who submerge  
in the task, who go into the fields to harvest  
and work in a row and pass the bags along,  
who are not parlor generals and field deserters  
but move in a common rhythm  
when the food must come in or the fire be put out.

The work of the world is common as mud.  
Botched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.  
But the thing worth doing well done  
has a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.  
Greek amphoras for wine or oil,  
Hopi vases that held corn, are put in museums  
but you know they were made to be used.  
The pitcher cries for water to carry  
and a person for work that is real.

## Pale Blue Dot
Carl Sagan

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMDJ-PcYXfo

From this distant vantage point, the earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us it is different. Consider again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The **aggregate of our joy and suffering**, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--**on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam**.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

**Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion** that we have some **privileged position** in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a **lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark**. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it **underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another**, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

## Still I Rise

Maya Angelou

https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46446/still-i-rise

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s29ZnvbQGGI

**You may write me down in history  
With your bitter, twisted lies,  
You may trod me in the very dirt  
But still, like dust, I'll rise**.

Does my sassiness upset you?  
Why are you beset with gloom?  
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells  
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,  
With the certainty of tides,  
Just like hopes springing high,  
Still I'll rise.

Did you want to see me broken?  
Bowed head and lowered eyes?  
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,  
Weakened by my soulful cries?

Does my haughtiness offend you?  
Don't you take it awful hard  
’Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines  
Diggin’ in my own backyard.

You may shoot me with your words,  
You may cut me with your eyes,  
You may kill me with your hatefulness,  
But still, like air, I’ll rise.

Does my sexiness upset you?  
Does it come as a surprise  
That I dance like I've got diamonds  
At the meeting of my thighs?

Out of the huts of history’s shame  
I rise  
Up from a past that’s rooted in pain  
I rise  
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,  
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.

**Leaving behind nights of terror and fear**  
**I rise**  
**Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear**  
**I rise**  
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,  
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.  
I rise  
I rise  
I rise.

## Discipline of Gratitude (DOG)

:::note

Interpreting everything thru the lens of the self…. operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the center of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world’s priorities.

:::

I can **choose to be grateful** even when my emotions and feelings are still steeped in hurt and resentment.

I can **choose to speak about goodness and beauty** even when my inner eye still looks for someone to accuse or something to call ugly. 

I can **choose to listen to voices that forgive** and to look at the faces that smile even while I still hear words of revenge and see grimaces of hatred.

It means not just being grateful for the good things, because that's easy, but also **to be grateful for the hard things too**. To be grateful even for our flaws, because in the end, **they make us stronger by giving us a chance to reach beyond our grasp**.

## To laugh often and much
Ralph Waldo Emerson

**To laugh often and much**;  
To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;   
To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends;  
To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others;   
**To leave the world a bit better**, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition;   
**To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded**.

## Dante
In the middle of the journey of my life, I found myself in a dark wood for I had lost the right path.

## The Highwayman
Alfred Noyes

The wind was a **torrent of darkness among the gusty trees**.  
The moon was a **ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas**  
The road was a **ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor**,  
And the highwayman came riding—  
Riding—riding—  
The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.

## Defeat
Khalil Gibran

Defeat, my Defeat, **my solitude and my aloofness;**  
You are dearer to me than a thousand triumphs,  
And sweeter to my heart than all world-glory.
 
Defeat, my Defeat, my self-knowledge and my defiance,  
Through you I know that I am yet young and swift of foot  
And not to be trapped by withering laurels.  
And in you I have found aloneness  
And the joy of being shunned and scorned.
 
Defeat, my Defeat, my shining sword and shield,  
In your eyes I have read  
That to be enthroned is to be enslaved,  
And to be understood is to be leveled down,  
And to be grasped is but to reach one’s fullness  
And like a ripe fruit to fall and be consumed.
 
Defeat, my Defeat, my bold companion,  
You shall hear my songs and my cries and my silences,  
And none but you shall speak to me of the beating of wings,  
And urging of seas,  
And of mountains that burn in the night,  
And you alone shall climb my steep and rocky soul.
 
Defeat, my Defeat, my deathless courage,  
**You and I shall laugh together with the storm,  
And together we shall dig graves for all that die in us,**  
**And we shall stand in the sun with a will,  
And we shall be dangerous.**

## A Psalm of Life
By HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW

What The Heart Of The Young Man Said To The Psalmist.

Tell me not, in mournful numbers,  
Life is but an empty dream!  
For the soul is dead that slumbers,  
And things are not what they seem.

Life is real! Life is earnest!  
And the grave is not its goal;  
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,  
Was not spoken of the soul.

Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,  
Is our destined end or way;  
But to act, that each to-morrow  
Find us farther than to-day.

Art is long, and Time is fleeting,  
And our hearts, though stout and brave,  
Still, like muffled drums, are beating  
Funeral marches to the grave.

In the world’s broad field of battle,  
In the bivouac of Life,  
Be not like dumb, driven cattle!  
Be a **hero in the strife!**

Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant!  
Let the dead Past bury its dead!  
Act,— act in the living Present!  
Heart within, and God o’erhead!

Lives of great men all remind us  
We can make our lives sublime,  
And, departing, leave behind us  
Footprints on the sands of time;

Footprints, that perhaps another,  
Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,  
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
Seeing, shall take heart again.

**Let us, then, be up and doing,  
With a heart for any fate;  
Still achieving, still pursuing,  
Learn to labor and to wait.**

## True Manliness 
James F. Clarke

## The Man Worthwhile
EW Wilcox

**It is easy enough to be pleasant,  
When life flows by like a song,  
But the man worth while is one who will smile,  
When everything goes dead wrong.**  
For the test of the heart is trouble,  
And it always comes with the years,  
And the smile that is worth the praises of earth,  
Is the smile that shines through tears.

It is easy enough to be prudent,  
When nothing tempts you to stray,  
When without or within no voice of sin  
Is luring your soul away;  
But it's only a negative virtue  
Until it is tried by fire,  
And the life that is worth the honor on earth,  
Is the one that resists desire.

By the cynic, the sad, the fallen,  
Who had no strength for the strife,  
The world's highway is cumbered to-day,  
They make up the sum of life.  
**But the virtue that conquers passion,  
And the sorrow that hides in a smile,  
It is these that are worth the homage on earth  
For we find them but once in a while.**

## The Cure at Troy
Seamus Heaney

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkCvwvcT1zE&feature=youtu.be

Human beings suffer.  
They torture one another.  
They get hurt and get hard.  
No poem or play or song  
Can fully right a wrong  
Inflicted and endured.

**History says, Don’t hope  
On the side of the grave,’  
But then, once in a lifetime  
The longed for tidal wave  
Of justice can rise up  
And hope and history rhyme.**

So hope for a great sea- change  
On the far side of revenge.  
Believe that a further shore  
Is reachable from here.  
Believe in miracles.  
And cures and healing wells.

## Undersea
Rachel Carson’s Lyrical and Revolutionary 1937 Masterpiece Inviting Humans to Explore Earth from the Perspective of Other Creatures

Neither you nor I, with our earth-bound senses, know  
the **foam and surge of the tide** that beats over the crab   
hiding under the seaweed of his tide-pool home;   
or the **lilt of the  long, slow swells of mid-ocean**, where shoals of wandering fish  prey and are preyed upon,   
and the dolphin **breaks the waves to  breathe the upper atmosphere**.

## Ithaka
C.P. Cavafy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lROaURscxzI

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8is5ZE4_CU

**As you set out for Ithaka  
hope your road is a long one**,  
full of adventure, full of discovery.  
**Laistrygonians, Cyclops,  
angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them**:  
you’ll never find things like that on your way  
as long as you **keep your thoughts raised high**,  
as long as a rare excitement  
stirs your spirit and your body.  
**Laistrygonians, Cyclops,  
wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them**  
unless you bring them along inside your soul,  
unless your soul sets them up in front of you.

Hope your road is a long one.  
May there be many summer mornings when,  
with what pleasure, what joy,  
you enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time;  
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations
to buy fine things,  
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,  
sensual perfume of every kind—  
as many sensual perfumes as you can;  
and may you visit many Egyptian cities  
to learn and go on learning from their scholars.

Keep Ithaka always in your mind.  
Arriving there is what you’re destined for.  
But don’t hurry the journey at all.  
Better if it lasts for years,  
so you’re old by the time you reach the island,  
wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,  
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.

Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.  
Without her you wouldn't have set out.  
She has nothing left to give you now.

And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.  
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,  
you’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.

**Laistrygonians, Cyclops,  
angry Poseidon—do not fear them  
You shall not encounter  
Such things on your way  
If your thoughts are raised high  
If enthusiasm stirs your spirit and body.**

## O Me! O Life!
Walt Whitman

Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,  
Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,  
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)  
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,  
Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,  
Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,  
The question, O me! so sad, recurring—**What good amid these, O me, O life?**

*Answer*.  
**That you are here—that life exists and identity,
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.**

## Edgar Albert Guest

### Courage
**Courage isn't a brilliant dash,  
A daring deed in a moment's flash**;  
It isn't an instantaneous thing  
Born of despair with a sudden spring

It isn't a creature of **flickered hope**  
Or the final tug at a slipping rope;  
But it's **something deep in the soul of man**  
That is working always to serve some plan.
 
Courage isn't the last resort  
In the work of life or the game of sport;  
It isn't a thing that a man can call  
At some future time when he's apt to fall;

If he hasn't it now, he will have it not  
When the strain is great and the pace is hot.  
For who would strive for a distant goal  
Must always have courage within his soul.

Courage isn't a dazzling light  
That flashes and passes away from sight;  
**It's a slow, unwavering, ingrained trait**  
**With the patience to work and the strength to wait**.

It's part of a man when his skies are blue,  
It's part of him when he has work to do.  
The brave man never is freed of it.  
He has it when there is no need of it.

Courage was never designed for show;  
It isn't a thing that can come and go;  
It's written in victory and defeat  
And every trial a man may meet.

It's part of his hours, his days and his years,  
**Back of his smiles and behind his tears**.  
**Courage is more than a daring deed:  
It's the breath of life and a strong man's creed.**

### There will always be something to do

There will always be something to do, my boy;  
There will always be wrongs to right;  
**There will always be need for a manly breed
And men unafraid to fight.**  
There will always be honor to guard, my boy;  
There will always be hills to climb,  
And tasks to do, and battles new  
From now to the end of time.
 
There will always be dangers to face, my boy;  
There will always be goals to take;  
Men shall be tried, when the roads divide,  
And proved by the choice they make.  
There will always be burdens to bear, my boy;  
There will always be need to pray;  
There will always be tears through the future years,  
As loved ones are borne away.
 
There will always be God to serve, my boy,  
And always the Flag above;  
They shall call to you until life is through  
For courage and strength and love.  
**So these are things that I dream, my boy,  
And have dreamed since your life began:  
That whatever befalls, when the old world calls,  
It shall find you a sturdy man.**

### Failure

**Failure is ceasing to try!  
‘Tis accepting defeat  
And to all you may meet  
Giving voice to a sigh**;  
‘Tis in thinking it vain  
To attempt furthermore  
And in bowing to pain  
When the muscles grow sore.

Failure is stepping aside  
From the brunt of the fray  
In a week-hearted way,  
Being content to abide  
In the shadows that fall,  
And in being afraid  
Out of life, after all,  
Nothing’s left to be made.

**Failure is thinking despair,  
The forsaking of hope,  
And refusal to cope  
With the day’s round of care.**  
It’s in heeding the cry,  
"All is lost !" and to stay  
With defeat and not try  
For the happier day.

### Don't Quit

**When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,  
when the road you're trudging seems all uphill**,  
when the funds are low and the debts are high,  
and you want to smile but you have to sigh,  
when care is pressing you down a bit -  
rest if you must, but don't you quit. 

Life is queer with its twists and turns.  
As everyone of us sometimes learns.  
And many a fellow turns about when he might have won had he stuck it out.  
**Don't give up though the pace seems slow - you may succeed with another blow.**  
Often the goal is nearer than it seems to a faint and faltering man;  
Often the struggler has given up when he might have captured the victor's cup;  
and he learned too late when the night came down,  
how close he was to the golden crown.  
Success is failure turned inside out - the silver tint of the clouds of doubt,  
and when you never can tell how close you are,  
it may be near when it seems afar;  
**so stick to the fight when you're hardest hit -  
it's when things seem worst, you must not quit.**  

## The Guest House
Jalaluddin Rumi  
*Translated by* Coleman Barks  

This being human is a guest house.  
Every morning a new arrival.  

A joy, a depression, a meanness,  
some momentary awareness comes  
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!  
Even if they’re a crowd of sorrows,  
who violently sweep your house  
empty of its furniture,  
still, treat each guest honorably.  
He may be clearing you out  
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,  
meet them at the door laughing,  
and invite them in.

Be grateful for whoever comes,  
because each has been sent  
as a **guide from beyond**.

## Let my country awake
Rabindranath Tagore

Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;
Where knowledge is free;
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
Where words come out from the depth of truth;
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action –
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.
